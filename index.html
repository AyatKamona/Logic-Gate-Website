            <section>
                    <p>Logic gates are electronic circuits that perform basic logical operations. They are the building blocks of digital electronics, 
                    and are used in everything from computers to smartphones to traffic lights.
                    At their core, logic gates take one or more inputs, perform a logical operation on those inputs, and produce an output.</p>
            
                    <p>There are four basic types of logic gates: AND, OR, NOT, and XOR. The AND gate produces an output only when all of its inputs are true.
                    The OR gate produces an output when any of its inputs are true. 
                    The NOT gate produces an output that is the opposite of its input. The XOR gate produces an output only when its inputs are different 
                    and these logic gates can be combined to form more complex circuits, which can perform more complex operations. 
                    For example, a simple circuit that adds two binary numbers together can be built using a combination of logic gates.</p>
                
                    <p>Understanding logic gates is important for anyone who wants to work in computer science or any field that relies on digital electronics.
                    It's also a fascinating subject in its own right, 
                    and can be a fun and rewarding area of study for anyone who wants to learn more about how the digital world works.</p>

                <h1>How to play</h2>
                    <p>In this logic gate puzzle game, you'll see a circuit board with various logic gates and input/output nodes.
                        Your goal is to manipulate the input nodes by clicking on them to create a circuit that produces the desired output.
                        There are six different gates: XOR, AND, OR, and NOT. Each gate takes one or more input signals and produces a single output signal. 
                        You need to understand the functionality of each gate and use them in the correct sequence to produce the correct output signal. 
                        The game requires logical reasoning, strategic thinking, and an understanding of the functionality of the various logic gates to complete.</p>
