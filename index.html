            <section>
                    <p>Logic gates are electronic circuits that perform basic logical operations. They are the building blocks of digital electronics, 
                    and are used in everything from computers to smartphones to traffic lights.
                    At their core, logic gates take one or more inputs, perform a logical operation on those inputs, and produce an output.</p>
            
                    <p>There are four basic types of logic gates: AND, OR, NOT, and XOR. The AND gate produces an output only when all of its inputs are true.
                    The OR gate produces an output when any of its inputs are true. 
                    The NOT gate produces an output that is the opposite of its input. The XOR gate produces an output only when its inputs are different 
                    and these logic gates can be combined to form more complex circuits, which can perform more complex operations. 
                    For example, a simple circuit that adds two binary numbers together can be built using a combination of logic gates.</p>
                
                    <p>Understanding logic gates is important for anyone who wants to work in computer science or any field that relies on digital electronics.
                    It's also a fascinating subject in its own right, 
                    and can be a fun and rewarding area of study for anyone who wants to learn more about how the digital world works.</p>

                <h1>How to play</h2>
                    <p>In this logic gate puzzle game, you'll see a circuit board with various logic gates and input/output nodes. 
                        The goal of the game is to use your knowledge of logic gates to turn on the light bulb at the end of the circuit. 
                        You'll need to activate the right combination of switches to make it happen.
                        Each red circle represents a switch that sends a signal to the attached logic gate, and clicking on it will activate it. 
                        You'll know its been activated when the circle turns green and the activated gate will send either a 1 or a 0 to the next gate in the circuit. 
                        There are six different gates: XOR, AND, OR, and NOT. Each gate takes one or more input signals and produces a single output signal.
                        Your job is to choose the right combination of gates to get the right output to turn on the light bulb.
                        Don't worry if you're not a logic gate expert we've got an easy level to get you started. 
                        Get ready to use your logic and problem-solving skills to become a master of logic gates!</p>
